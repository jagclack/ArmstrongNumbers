# ArmstrongNumbers

## Instructions
Open the source code of Main.java and ArmstronChecker.java within IntelliJ IDEA and execute the program within Main.java with the hard-coded integer given within the Main method. Dependencies required: JUnit.

## Highlights
ArmstrongChecker.java contains all logic behind the execution of the program. Tests are covered in AppTest.java

## Improvements
A useful feature to include would be a user input for the integer so that anyone using the program can control the integer that is checked to confirm if it is an Armstrong number.
